    "### Fit 3D lines to cylinders\n",
    "This project aims at fitting lines in 3D to data consisting of cylinders (produced by individual Geiger counters). Each cylinder is hence centred around an individual wire (parallel to the z-axis) on a regular grid and has a fixed radius. The cylinder height corresponds to a fixed z-coordinate error. The radius also has an error (at 10% of the radius value or at least 0.5 mm).\n",

    "You have access to a file containing 10 events. The format is defined below. Each event contains data corresponding to two\n",

The `runFit(infile, outfile)` function should steer the execution of the entire code with the benefit that it can be used to measure the execution time (will be done in the test, but also useful for yourself). The `readData(filename)` function is independent of the file content and can read the compressed files, for testing or later for assessment. Two data files will be supplied for the project for your own testing. One contains 10 events in the right data format and one contains truth information (as human readable file) for checking your own code. The model solution fits all 10 events correctly.\n",

Note that you should not take that insight as a fixed parameter (would lead to a reduction of marks) but as a reassurance to test your attempts relatively easily. The assessment data file also has the creation intercept set at `z=0` for all events.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hint 2**: The errors on the intercept in z and the slope in the x-z plane are likely to be big, occasionally. Not to worry, this reflects the large error on the z-coordinate which can induce a broad minimum and hence big errors. This observation simply is in the nature of the data.\n",

    "In all likelihood, not all fits will be successful. The model solution achieves a 98% efficiency. Your code will be run on a larger data file with 1000 events on the assessment workstation. 10 out of 20 marks will be awarded for solutions reaching 98% or higher efficiency (with the caveat of manually checking the code for correctness, of course). Note that your code efficiency will be cross checked with the truth data, i.e. the slopes and intercepts which produced each event. A successful fit for the assessment will hence have to satisfy a comparison between your parameter fit solutions and the truth values within the errors of your fit results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Further 5 marks are awarded for the correct plot, i.e. similar to the example picture, plot the x-y plane with data Circles and your fit solution line (in that 2D plane). The final marks are awarded for any successful effort on speeding up the execution time compared to the pure, serial Python solution. Fitting 1000 events takes a fairly long time (a bit more than 15 minutes on my humble machine) hence any successful speed optimization is appreciated with up to 5 marks. Optimization can bring the time down to 40 s but at the expense of efficiency. The 98% efficiency was achieved in about 95 s."
